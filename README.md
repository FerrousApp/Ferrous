# Ferrous

**Ferrous** gives you access to a curated portfolio of compliant blockchain based global financial instruments, ranging from real-world assets (RWAs) to tokenized bonds, yield-bearing defi instruments and  stablecoin liquidity pools etc

### 🔹 Why Ferrous?

In many markets, access to reliable investment opportunities is limited by geography, high entry barriers, lack of transparency, and unstable local financial systems. Traditional banks offer low returns, while access to global financial markets remains out of reach for the average person.

At the same time, blockchain has unlocked powerful new financial instruments: from tokenized real-world assets to yield-generating stablecoin protocols, but these are often inaccessible to everyday users due to technical complexity, regulatory concerns, and the need for crypto-native knowledge. There is a growing need for a secure, compliant, and user-friendly platform that bridges fiat currency with safe, transparent blockchain-based investments.
